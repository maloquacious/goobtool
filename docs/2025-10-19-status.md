# Goobergine Application Generator v0.1-alpha Summary

## Overview
v0.1-alpha marks the foundational release of the Goobergine Application Generator, delivering a minimal viable product (MVP) with core web server functionality and administrative tools. This version establishes the essential architecture for a secure, portable web application generator built in Go, focusing on simplicity, security, and extensibility. It provides a single binary that can serve web content and be managed via a local admin interface, with built-in datastore support.

## Key Deliverables
v0.1-alpha introduces the following core capabilities:

### Core Server Functionality
- **Single Binary Application**: A self-contained executable that runs both the public web server and administrative command-line interface (CLI).
- **Basic Web Serving**: Serves HTML content on a configurable port (default 8080), with graceful shutdown and automatic testing modes.
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in endpoints (`/live`, `/ready`, `/version`) for process health checks, readiness status, and version information.

### Administrative Interface
- **Secure Admin Channel**: A separate, loopback-only admin port (default 8383) that enforces JSON-only communication for security. No remote access or authentication is included in this version to maintain simplicity.
- **Admin Commands**: Full CLI for database management (`db create`, `db verify`) and server control (`server status`, `server shutdown`, `server echo`), plus maintenance mode toggling.
- **Maintenance Mode**: Ability to put the server into maintenance, serving appropriate pages and restricting public access while keeping admin functions available.

### Datastore and Configuration
- **SQLite-Based Storage**: Portable datastore using modern SQLite with safe defaults (WAL mode, foreign keys enabled) and extensible interfaces for future backends.
- **Configuration System**: Persistent configuration table with load priorities (defaults → persisted → flags/env), supporting bootstrap overrides for key settings.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic handling of datastore initialization, version checks, and installation states, with guidance for setup.

### Error Handling and Observability
- **Uniform Error Responses**: Consistent JSON error formats for admin APIs and HTML error pages for public routes, with stable error codes.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for startup, shutdown, store checks, admin actions, and maintenance events using Go's standard logger.
- **Security-First Design**: Enforced loopback-only admin binding, JSON-only policies, and protections against misconfigurations.

### Documentation and Quickstart
- **Security Considerations**: Detailed guide covering enforced policies, SQLite best practices, and deferred hardening for production use.
- **Quickstart Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for creating the datastore, starting the server, and using admin commands.

## Benefits for Stakeholders
- **Developers/Project Managers**: A solid, testable foundation for building web applications, with clear separation of public and admin concerns. Enables rapid prototyping and iteration in future versions.
- **Customers/Users**: A simple, secure way to run and manage generated web applications locally, with built-in tools for maintenance and monitoring. The design ensures portability and ease of deployment.
- **Business Value**: Establishes credibility through security-focused architecture, setting the stage for enterprise-ready features in subsequent versions.

## Scope and Limitations
v0.1-alpha is intentionally minimal, focusing on backend infrastructure without frontend UI or advanced features like sessions, CSRF, or RBAC. These are reserved for v0.2 and later. The admin interface is local-only for security, with no user authentication or remote management.

## Next Steps
After v0.1-alpha, v0.2 will introduce HTMX-based frontend UX, session management, and user authentication, transforming the generator into a fully interactive web application platform. This incremental approach ensures each release delivers tangible value while maintaining high quality.

For any questions or feedback on v0.1-alpha, please reach out to the development team. We're excited to deliver this core foundation!
